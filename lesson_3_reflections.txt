When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Always when I want to store my repository not only on my local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it gives you more freedom to choose when you need to add files to Github.
